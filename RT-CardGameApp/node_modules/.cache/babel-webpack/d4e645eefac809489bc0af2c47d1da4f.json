containing a  list of `state()`\n   * and `transition()` entries to be evaluated when the expression\n   * bound to the trigger changes.\n   *\n   * @param name An identifying string.\n   * @param definitions  An animation definition object, containing an array of `state()`\n   * and `transition()` declarations.\n   *\n   * @return An object that encapsulates the trigger data.\n   *\n   * @usageNotes\n   * Define an animation trigger in the `animations` section of `@Component` metadata.\n   * In the template, reference the trigger by name and bind it to a trigger expression that\n   * evaluates to a defined animation state, using the following format:\n   *\n   * `[@triggerName]=\"expression\"`\n   *\n   * Animation trigger bindings convert all values to strings, and then match the\n   * previous and current values against any linked transitions.\n   * Booleans can be specified as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false`.\n   *\n   * ### Usage Example\n   *\n   * The following example creates an animation trigger reference based on the provided\n   * name value.\n   * The provided animation value is expected to be an array consisting of state and\n   * transition declarations.\n   *\n   * ```typescript\n   * @Component({\n   *   selector: \"my-component\",\n   *   templateUrl: \"my-component-tpl.html\",\n   *   animations: [\n   *     trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n   *       state(...),\n   *       state(...),\n   *       transition(...),\n   *       transition(...)\n   *     ])\n   *   ]\n   * })\n   * class MyComponent {\n   *   myStatusExp = \"something\";\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * The template associated with this component makes use of the defined trigger\n   * by binding to an element within its template code.\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n   * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Using an inline function\n   * The `transition` animation method also supports reading an inline function which can decide\n   * if its associated animation should be run.\n   *\n   * ```typescript\n   * // this method is run each time the `myAnimationTrigger` trigger value changes.\n   * function myInlineMatcherFn(fromState: string, toState: string, element: any, params: {[key:\n   string]: any}): boolean {\n   *   // notice that `element` and `params` are also available here\n   *   return toState == 'yes-please-animate';\n   * }\n   *\n   * @Component({\n   *   selector: 'my-component',\n   *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',\n   *   animations: [\n   *     trigger('myAnimationTrigger', [\n   *       transition(myInlineMatcherFn, [\n   *         // the animation sequence code\n   *       ]),\n   *     ])\n   *   ]\n   * })\n   * class MyComponent {\n   *   myStatusExp = \"yes-please-animate\";\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Disabling Animations\n   * When true, the special animation control binding `@.disabled` binding prevents\n   * all animations from rendering.\n   * Place the  `@.disabled` binding on an element to disable\n   * animations on the element itself, as well as any inner animation triggers\n   * within the element.\n   *\n   * The following example shows how to use this feature:\n   *\n   * ```typescript\n   * @Component({\n   *   selector: 'my-component',\n   *   template: `\n   *     <div [@.disabled]=\"isDisabled\">\n   *       <div [@childAnimation]=\"exp\"></div>\n   *     </div>\n   *   `,\n   *   animations: [\n   *     trigger(\"childAnimation\", [\n   *       // ...\n   *     ])\n   *   ]\n   * })\n   * class MyComponent {\n   *   isDisabled = true;\n   *   exp = '...';\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * When `@.disabled` is true, it prevents the `@childAnimation` trigger from animating,\n   * along with any inner animations.\n   *\n   * ### Disable animations application-wide\n   * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled,\n   * **all** inner components have their animations disabled as well.\n   * This means that you can disable all animations for an app\n   * by placing a host binding set on `@.disabled` on the topmost Angular component.\n   *\n   * ```typescript\n   * import {Component, HostBinding} from '@angular/core';\n   *\n   * @Component({\n   *   selector: 'app-component',\n   *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',\n   * })\n   * class AppComponent {\n   *   @HostBinding('@.disabled')\n   *   public animationsDisabled = true;\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Overriding disablement of inner animations\n   * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can `query()`\n   * for inner elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate\n   * them if needed. This is also the case for when a sub animation is\n   * queried by a parent and then later animated using `animateChild()`.\n   *\n   * ### Detecting when an animation is disabled\n   * If a region of the DOM (or the entire application) has its animations disabled, the animation\n   * trigger callbacks still fire, but for zero seconds. When the callback fires, it provides\n   * an instance of an `AnimationEvent`. If animations are disabled,\n   * the `.disabled` flag on the event is true.\n   *\n   * @publicApi\n   */\n\n  function trigger(name, definitions) {\n    return {\n      type: 7\n      /* Trigger */\n      ,\n      name: name,\n      definitions: definitions,\n      options: {}\n    };\n  }\n  /**\n   * Defines an animation step that combines styling information with timing information.\n   *\n   * @param timings Sets `AnimateTimings` for the parent animation.\n   * A string in the format \"duration [delay] [easing]\".\n   *  - Duration and delay are expressed as a number and optional time unit,\n   * such as \"1s\" or \"10ms\" for one second and 10 milliseconds, respectively.\n   * The default unit is milliseconds.\n   *  - The easing value controls how the animation accelerates and decelerates\n   * during its runtime.

Angular automatically adds or removes\n   * CSS styles to ensure that the element is in the correct final state.\n   *\n   * The following example defines a transition that starts by hiding the element,\n   * then makes sure that it animates properly to whatever state is currently active for trigger:\n   *\n   * ```typescript\n   * transition(\"void => *\", [\n   *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n   *   animate(500)\n   *  ])\n   * ```\n   * ### Boolean value matching\n   * If a trigger binding value is a Boolean, it can be matched using a transition expression\n   * that compares true and false or 1 and 0. For example:\n   *\n   * ```\n   * // in the template\n   * <div [@openClose]=\"open ? true : false\">...</div>\n   * // in the component metadata\n   * trigger('openClose', [\n   *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),\n   *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),\n   *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))\n   * ])\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @publicApi\n   **/\n\n\n  function transition(stateChangeExpr, steps, options) {\n    if (options === void 0) {\n      options = null;\n    }\n\n    return {\n      type: 1\n      /* Transition */\n      ,\n      expr: stateChangeExpr,\n      animation: steps,\n      options: options\n    };\n  }\n  /**\n   * Produces a reusable animation that can be invoked in another animation or sequence,\n   * by calling the `useAnimation()` function.\n   *\n   * @param steps One or more animation objects, as returned by the `animate()`\n   * or `sequence()` function, that form a transformation from one state to another.\n   * A sequence is used by default when you pass an array.\n   * @param options An options object that can contain a delay value for the start of the\n   * animation, and additional developer-defined parameters.\n   * Provided values for additional parameters are used as defaults,\n   * and override values can be passed to the caller on invocation.\n   * @returns An object that encapsulates the animation data.\n   *\n   * @usageNotes\n   * The following example defines a reusable animation, providing some default parameter\n   * values.\n   *\n   * ```typescript\n   * var fadeAnimation = animation([\n   *   style({ opacity: '{{ start }}' }),\n   *   animate('{{ time }}',\n   *   style({ opacity: '{{ end }}'}))\n   *   ],\n   *   { params: { time: '1000ms', start: 0, end: 1 }});\n   * ```\n   *\n   * The following invokes the defined animation with a call to `useAnimation()`,\n   * passing in override parameter values.\n   *\n   * ```js\n   * useAnimation(fadeAnimation, {\n   *   params: {\n   *     time: '2s',\n   *     start: 1,\n   *     end: 0\n   *   }\n   * })\n   * ```\n   *\n   * If any of the passed-in parameter values are missing from this call,\n   * the default values are used.

Use the `build()` method to create a programmatic animation using the\n     * `animate()` function. The method returns an `AnimationFactory` instance.\n     *\n     * 2. Use the factory object to create an `AnimationPlayer` and attach it to a DOM element.\n     *\n     * 3. Use the player object to control the animation programmatically.\n     *\n     * For example:\n     *\n     * ```ts\n     * // import the service from BrowserAnimationsModule\n     * import {AnimationBuilder} from '@angular/animations';\n     * // require the service as a dependency\n     * class MyCmp {\n     *   constructor(private _builder: AnimationBuilder) {}\n     *\n     *

  * and `transition()` declarations.\n     *\n     * @return An object that encapsulates the trigger data.\n     *\n     * @usageNotes\n     * Define an animation trigger in the `animations` section of `@Component` metadata.\n     * In the template, reference the trigger by name and bind it to a trigger expression that\n     * evaluates to a defined animation state, using the following format:\n     *\n     * `[@triggerName]=\"expression\"`\n     *\n     * Animation trigger bindings convert all values to strings, and then match the\n     * previous and current values against any linked transitions.\n     * Booleans can be specified as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false`.\n     *\n     * ### Usage Example\n     *\n     * The following example creates an animation trigger reference based on the provided\n     * name value.\n     * The provided animation value is expected to be an array consisting of state and\n     * transition declarations.\n     *\n     * ```typescript\n     * @Component({\n     *   selector: \"my-component\",\n     *   templateUrl: \"my-component-tpl.html\",\n     *   animations: [\n     *     trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n     *       state(...),\n     *       state(...),\n     *       transition(...),\n     *       transition(...)\n     *     ])\n     *   ]\n     * })\n     * class MyComponent {\n     *   myStatusExp = \"something\";\n     * }\n     * ```\n     *\n     * The template associated with this component makes use of the defined trigger\n     * by binding to an element within its template code.\n     *\n     * ```html\n     * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n     * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ### Using an inline function\n     * The `transition` animation method also supports reading an inline function which can decide\n     * if its associated animation should be run.\n     *\n     * ```typescript\n     * // this method is run each time the `myAnimationTrigger` trigger value changes.\n     * function myInlineMatcherFn(fromState: string, toState: string, element: any, params: {[key:\n     string]: any}): boolean {\n     *   // notice that `element` and `params` are also available here\n     *   return toState == 'yes-please-animate';\n     * }\n     *\n     * @Component({\n     *   selector: 'my-component',\n     *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',\n     *   animations: [\n     *     trigger('myAnimationTrigger', [\n     *       transition(myInlineMatcherFn, [\n     *         // the animation sequence code\n     *       ]),\n     *     ])\n     *   ]\n     * })\n     * class MyComponent {\n     *   myStatusExp = \"yes-please-animate\";\n     * }\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ### Disabling Animations\n     * When true, the special animation control binding `@.disabled` binding prevents\n     * all animations from rendering.\n     * Place the  `@.disabled` binding on an element to disable\n     * animations on the element itself, as well as any inner animation triggers\n     * within the element.\n     *\n     * The following example shows how to use this feature:\n     *\n     * ```typescript\n     * @Component({\n     *   selector: 'my-component',\n     *   template: `\n     *     <div [@.disabled]=\"isDisabled\">\n     *       <div [@childAnimation]=\"exp\"></div>\n     *     </div>\n     *   `,\n     *   animations: [\n     *     trigger(\"childAnimation\", [\n     *       // ...\n     *     ])\n     *   ]\n     * })\n     * class MyComponent {\n     *   isDisabled = true;\n     *   exp = '...';\n     * }\n     * ```\n     *\n     * When `@.disabled` is true, it prevents the `@childAnimation` trigger from animating,\n     * along with any inner animations.\n     *\n     * ### Disable animations application-wide\n     * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled,\n     * **all** inner components have their animations disabled as well.\n     * This means that you can disable all animations for an app\n     * by placing a host binding set on `@.disabled` on the topmost Angular component.\n     *\n     * ```typescript\n     * import {Component, HostBinding} from '@angular/core';\n     *\n     * @Component({\n     *   selector: 'app-component',\n     *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',\n     * })\n     * class AppComponent {\n     *   @HostBinding('@.disabled')\n     *   public animationsDisabled = true;\n     * }\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ### Overriding disablement of inner animations\n     * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can `query()`\n     * for inner elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate\n     * them if needed. This is also the case for when a sub animation is\n     * queried by a parent and then later animated using `animateChild()`.\n     *\n     * ### Detecting when an animation is disabled\n     * If a region of the DOM (or the entire application) has its animations disabled, the animation\n     * trigger callbacks still fire, but for zero seconds. When the callback fires, it provides\n     * an instance of an `AnimationEvent`. If animations are disabled,\n     * the `.disabled` flag on the event is true.\n     *\n     * @publicApi\n     */\n    function trigger(name, definitions) {\n        return { type: 7 /* Trigger */, name: name, definitions: definitions, options: {} };\n    }\n    /**\n     * Defines an animation step that combines styling information with timing information.\n     *\n     * @param timings Sets `AnimateTimings` for the parent animation.\n     * A string in the format \"duration [delay] [easing]\".\n     *  - Duration and delay are expressed as a number and optional time unit,\n     * such as \"1s\" or \"10ms\" for one second and 10 milliseconds, respectively.\n     * The default unit is milliseconds.\n     *  - The easing value controls how the animation accelerates and decelerates\n     * during its runtime.

Angular automatically adds or removes\n     * CSS styles to ensure that the element is in the correct final state.\n     *\n     * The following example defines a transition that starts by hiding the element,\n     * then makes sure that it animates properly to whatever state is currently active for trigger:\n     *\n     * ```typescript\n     * transition(\"void => *\", [\n     *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n     *   animate(500)\n     *  ])\n     * ```\n     * ### Boolean value matching\n     * If a trigger binding value is a Boolean, it can be matched using a transition expression\n     * that compares true and false or 1 and 0. For example:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * // in the template\n     * <div [@openClose]=\"open ? true : false\">...</div>\n     * // in the component metadata\n     * trigger('openClose', [\n     *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),\n     *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),\n     *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))\n     * ])\n     * ```\n     *\n     * @publicApi\n     **/\n    function transition(stateChangeExpr, steps, options) {\n        if (options === void 0) { options = null; }\n        return { type: 1 /* Transition */, expr: stateChangeExpr, animation: steps, options: options };\n    }\n    /**\n     * Produces a reusable animation that can be invoked in another animation or sequence,\n     * by calling the `useAnimation()` function.\n     *\n     * @param steps One or more animation objects, as returned by the `animate()`\n     * or `sequence()` function, that form a transformation from one state to another.\n     * A sequence is used by default when you pass an array.\n     * @param options An options object that can contain a delay value for the start of the\n     * animation, and additional developer-defined parameters.\n     * Provided values for additional parameters are used as defaults,\n     * and override values can be passed to the caller on invocation.\n     * @returns An object that encapsulates the animation data.\n     *\n     * @usageNotes\n     * The following example defines a reusable animation, providing some default parameter\n     * values.\n     *\n     * ```typescript\n     * var fadeAnimation = animation([\n     *   style({ opacity: '{{ start }}' }),\n     *   animate('{{ time }}',\n     *   style({ opacity: '{{ end }}'}))\n     *   ],\n     *   { params: { time: '1000ms', start: 0, end: 1 }});\n     * ```\n     *\n     * The following invokes the defined animation with a call to `useAnimation()`,\n     * passing in override parameter values.\n     *\n     * ```js\n     * useAnimation(fadeAnimation, {\n     *   params: {\n     *     time: '2s',\n     *     start: 1,\n     *     end: 0\n     *   }\n     * })\n     * ```\n     *\n     * If any of the passed-in parameter values are missing from this call,\n     * the default values are used.
